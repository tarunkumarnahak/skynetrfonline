* Added fragments to exceptions, allowing retrieval of incomplete receives' contents, and byte count on incomplete sends.
* Changed Stream to use an fread/fwrite duo instead of stream_copy_to_stream() for the sake of stability.
* Tweaked Stream::isAcceptingData() and NetworkStream::isAvailable(), in order to work around a reproducible hang on Linux.
* Doc fixes.
